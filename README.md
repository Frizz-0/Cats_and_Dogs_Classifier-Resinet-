## 📌 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end Computer Vision application that classifies images of cats and dogs. It utilizes a **Fine-Tuned ResNet18** architecture to achieve high accuracy, wrapped in a user-friendly **Streamlit** web interface, and containerized with **Docker** for seamless deployment.

This project demonstrates the transition from a research-based model to a production-ready AI application.

## 🚀 Features

- **Deep Learning Model:** Fine-tuned ResNet18 (Transfer Learning) on a custom dataset.
- **Interactive UI:** A sleek web interface built with Streamlit for real-time image uploads and predictions.
- **Containerization:** Fully Dockerized to ensure "it works on my machine" translates to "it works everywhere."
- **Scalable Design:** Modular Python code structure.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework:** PyTorch
- **Architecture:** ResNet18 (Pre-trained on ImageNet)
- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Deployment:** Docker
- **Libraries:** Torchvision, PIL, NumPy
